# CMD_-MyProgram-

This is mini "command system", it kinda looks like one and has some features of CMD Prompt.
It's features are sending emails, creating; deleting; copying files, and retrieving and emailing the systems IP.
100% C# and my first ever actual project with code! :D


## How To Use

It's as simple as run it and type something random for the first time!

All **Program** features are used as *Program.--()*. 

**System** features are used one at a time based on the level printed in the **Program.Help()** menu. Example would be like *System Directory* -> `Directoy Menu` -> *cd* -> `CD Menu`


## Installing
Uhhh.... This wasn't made for use... kinda just a project of mine, [Hand Tracking](https://github.com/Connor12858/Hand-Tracking) is a project currently under development and something you can use!! - When Completed
